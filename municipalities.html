							"ili" first settled by a man named Biag who fled his village of Bika,
							Abra from marauding headhunters. Biag first went to Candon, Ilocos 
							Sur but when baptism was enforced by the Spaniards thereat, he moved 
							back to the mountains until he settled in Sagada. It is not known 
							whether Biag had a name for his settlement, now known as Sagada,
							but accounts of a story tell of two exploring Spanish soldiers
							who met  a man carrying a bamboo basket used to catch fish, and
							asked the man the name of the place. Thinking that the soldiers
							were asking what he was carrying, the man answered "sagada".

							on the north by Tubo, Abra, on the south by Tadian, on the east 
							by Sagada, and on the west by Quirino, Ilocos Sur. While the poetic 
							name of Besao is Golinsan, it is believed that it derived its name 
							from the Ilocano word "busol" or "buso" because the "Besaos"were
							fierce tribal warriors during the primitive times protecting and
							defending their land from invaders. "Besaos" later evolved to Besao,
							and thereafter the town carried this name up to the present.
							A peaceful town of some 8,000 people, the people of Besao belongs 
							to the Aplai tribe majority of whom are Christians belonging to 
							the Philippine Episcopal Church (Anglican).

							that form streams and rivers. Natonin hosts four ethno-linguistic
							tribes of unsure origins; i-Farangaos, i-Majukayong, i-Kachakran,
							and i-Balangao. It is amazing that these tribes would understand
							each of the other when they converse and communicate.
